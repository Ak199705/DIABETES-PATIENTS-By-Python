# DIABETES-PATIENTS-By-Python
 🌟 Excited to share my latest data analysis project from MeriSkill! 📊💼

Delving into the world of healthcare data, I had the privilege to work on a captivating dataset originating from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 🏥💻

The heart of the project revolves around predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients, leveraging diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 📈🔍

What's particularly intriguing is the meticulous selection process of these instances from a larger database. 🧐 All patients in this dataset are incredible women, aged at least 21 years, proudly carrying the heritage of Pima Indian descent. 🌺💪

As I sifted through the data, each datapoint held stories of resilience and determination. 💖 My journey involved uncovering insights and patterns that could potentially make a significant impact on healthcare outcomes. 🌟

Stay tuned for the incredible discoveries and insights waiting to be unveiled! 💫 #DataAnalysis #Healthcare #DiabetesPrediction #WomenInSTEM
